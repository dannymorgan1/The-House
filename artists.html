                <h3>Kettama</h3>
                <p>Evan Campbell, better known as Kettama, is a Galway native making waves in the techno music industry. His raw, old-school and high-energy techno tracks have catapulted the Irishman to fame. Kettama's unique style can be attributed to the fact that he produces his tracks exclusively "in the box", meaning he doesn't use external hardware for his music productions. His style is 90's-esque and is influenced heavily by techno legends, such as Palace and Glenn Underground. His top single, <i>B.O.D.Y.</i>, is popular among house enthusiasts and was famously played by house icon Mall Grab. Listen to a sample from the song that put Kettama on the map, <i>Eastside Avenue.</i></p>
